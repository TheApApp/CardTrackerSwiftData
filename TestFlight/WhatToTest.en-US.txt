Things to Test:

2. Added a search bar to the Greeting Card Picker
3. Check the new menuing .. I think I am very close.

Known bugs:
#. Something has changed and the application is ignoring the accent colors and dark mode.  Will try and resolve this.
#. Bag in macOS - if you change the name of a card, you lose the picture and canâ€™t update
