This is the initial build of Greeting Tracker.  Please note it is very rough around the edges.

The primary things to test right now:
0) Confirm that the app works on iPhone, iPad, and macOS
1) create new event types, things like Birthday, Christmas, etc. Try it in multiple languages
2) Create a gallery of cards for the types you created
3) add a few people with address information, try both getting data from Contacts, and manually entering
4) Given them a few different cards on different days
5) see if it correctly syncs data between your iPad and you Mac

Thank you for being willing to test this out.
