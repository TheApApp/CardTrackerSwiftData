Starting work on my second mainteance release.

Found bug in image sizing code, have rewriten, this means you need to remove and recreate all cards - sorry.

Removed temporary build to test changing from LazyVGrid to List view did not address large galleries afterall, and formatting issues were not very good.

Things to Test:
0. Remove and re-add all cards - see if performance improves.
1. Initial Code added for VisionOS support.
2. Please test using large galleries.
