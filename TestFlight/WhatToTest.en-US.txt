This is the initial build of Greeting Tracker.  Please note it is very rough around the edges.

A few things to test in v16
0) Confirm that the app works on iPhone, iPad, and macOS
1) create new event types, things like Birthday, Christmas, etc. Try it in multiple languages
2) Create a gallery of cards for the types you created
3) add a few people with address information, try both getting data from Contacts, and manually entering
4) Given them a few different cards on different days
5) see if it correctly syncs data between your iPad and you Mac
6) Save to PDF or print - confirm that each view prints data that makes sense for that view

A few things more to test in v17
1) Rewrote handling of image loads (trying to address performance).  Question on full screen image, is there a meaningful photo deregation 

Thank you for being willing to test this out.
