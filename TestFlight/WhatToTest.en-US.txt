This is the initial build of Greeting Tracker.  Please note it is very rough around the edges.

Right now it is recommended that you test on iPadOS and macOS only.  I am having issues with iPhone rendering of the menuing.

The primary things to test right now:
1) create new event types, things like Birthday, Christmas, etc. Try it in multiple languages
2) Create a gallery of cards for the types you created
3) add a few people with address information, try both getting data from Contacts, and manually entering
4) Given them a few different cards on different days
5) see if it correctly syncs data between your iPad and you Mac

Please report any crashes.

Coming soon, Changing the main menuing to simple two panel view, hopefully will fix issue with iPhone.  Will provide a Picker to choose which view you start with, will remember view for next time you enter the app.

Thank you for being willing to test this out.
