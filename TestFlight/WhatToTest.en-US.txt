Close to second mainteance release.

Found bug in image sizing code, have rewriten, this means you need to remove and recreate all cards - sorry.

Things to Test:
0. Remove and re-add all cards - see if performance improves.
1. Initial Code added for VisionOS support.
2. Please test using large galleries, (note please wipe your existing data if at all possible, due to issue with prior compression issues.)
3. Note you must have both an event and a card selected to save a new card for a recipient - I may add an error popup
