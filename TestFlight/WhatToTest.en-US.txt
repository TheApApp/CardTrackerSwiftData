Things to Test:
1. Added new none used displayes
2. Fixed display of delete screen

Known bugs:
#. Bag in macOS - if you change the name of a card, you lose the picture and canâ€™t update
#. iOS - if you go thru initial setup, and deny access to the Contacts the app crashes you out.  When you restart you will get the popup of permissions not set for contacts.
