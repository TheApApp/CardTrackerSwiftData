Initial feature redesign for adding events and cards

Things to Test:
1. You can now create a new event when adding a card to the gallery.  What do you think of the User Experience? (feature - Add to both the Event and Card Pickers in the Recipient view - ability to add a new item)
2. Card Website should no longer auto capitalize the "H" in "https"
3. Added ability to edit a recipient's address and more (is this discoverable?)
4. Added ability to classification a recipient: i.e. work, family, friends. etc.

Known bugs:
1. Bug in macOS - can’t access Camera even if setting says permitted
2. Bag in macOS - if you change the name of a card, you lose the picture and can’t update

Things yet to come:
1. Correct VisionOS layout issues
2. Resolve issue with Receipient Title, with Cards Sent, changing from color to black
3. Bug Fix - on the delete for the Card App - Issue is that the Events list needs to remove the array element after the Child is deleted
4. Update the slide view to fill the slide with the card image and make the click on the image give you the full screen view

1. Add filter by name option in the Card picker view
1. Add card name to the add Card to receipient view
1. Add an app intent to show a gallery of a specific event type’s cards
