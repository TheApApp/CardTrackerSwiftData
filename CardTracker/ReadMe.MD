## Greeting Tracker

An App by Mchael Rowe, the goal of this app is to create an easy to use way of tracking the various greeting cards you may send out; while also helping me learn SwiftData.

I am opensourcing the code, in order to learn from others.  Note there are two package Dependencies, that I would like to remove over time.

Items to address right now:
1. It seems that I may not have been saving the right image when trying to compress.. leading to the peformance issues.  My latest code hopefully will fix this.
